Invoice Generator Project - Stripe Integration Issues

  I'm working on a simple invoice generator web application with a specific tech stack
  and deployment pipeline that's mostly working, but I'm having persistent Stripe payment
   integration issues.

  Project Context:
  - Architecture: Single-page application (SPA) - all functionality in one index.html
  file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
  - No backend/database: Entirely client-side, uses localStorage for persistence
  - Deployment: Automated GitHub â†’ Vercel pipeline (pushes to GitHub main branch
  automatically deploy to Vercel)
  - Development workflow: Claude Code â†’ GitHub â†’ Vercel (works perfectly)

  Core Functionality (WORKING):
  - Invoice form with auto-generated invoice numbers âœ…
  - Real-time calculations (item totals, tax, grand total) âœ…
  - Live preview of invoice âœ…
  - PDF generation using jsPDF library âœ…
  - Premium features system (25 invoice limit, watermark removal) âœ…

  Stripe Integration Goal:
  - $5 one-time payment to unlock premium (remove watermarks, 25 invoice tracking)
  - Using Stripe test mode during development
  - Test publishable key: pk_test_51RIaSlQ0VFX8PYxQ8vJ14Q4isN5uGcbsaH41gcmbXCQjSBhmlZul68
  dPV9yhPsJl9NRJ8lFWVK8CKXtv0mgppLip00lMwnozj8
  - Test price ID: price_1S9RFRQ0VFX8PYxQaZndix94 (confirmed correct in Stripe dashboard)

  Persistent Issues:
  1. Popup error on page load in incognito browser: Shows "unexpected error" message
  immediately upon loading
  2. "Payment system error" when clicking premium button: Button click results in generic
   error, Stripe checkout never opens

  What We've Tried:
  - Confirmed Stripe is in test/sandbox mode (correct for development)
  - Verified price ID format is correct (price_ not prod_)
  - Fixed library loading race conditions
  - Added comprehensive error handling and production environment detection
  - Problem: Recent "fixes" broke core invoice functionality (calculations,
  auto-generation, preview)
  - Current state: Reverted to working core app, still has original Stripe issues

  Technical Details:
  - Stripe.js loaded via CDN: https://js.stripe.com/v3/
  - Using stripe.redirectToCheckout() method
  - Success/cancel URLs configured for current domain
  - All in test mode, should work with test card 4242 4242 4242 4242

  Key Constraints:
  - Must remain single-file application (no build process)
  - Cannot break core invoice functionality (calculations, preview, PDF generation)
  - Need to work in both development and production (Vercel deployment)
  - GitHub integration must remain intact

  Questions for you:
  1. What could cause "Payment system error" with correct test credentials?
  2. What causes popup errors on page load specifically in incognito mode?
  3. Any specific Stripe test mode requirements I might be missing?
  4. Minimal changes to fix Stripe without breaking core functionality?

  Files to include:
  - Should I provide the current index.html file?
  - Any specific Stripe dashboard configuration details needed?
  - Browser console errors from the live site?

  Expected outcome:
  Minimal, targeted fix for Stripe integration that doesn't modify the working invoice
  calculation and preview logic.

  Additional items for context:

  1. The actual index.html file - The LLM will need to see the current code structure (see codebase)
  2. Browser console errors - Copy any specific error messages from the browser console
  when the issues occur
  3. Vercel deployment URL - So they can test the live environment
  4. Specific browser/environment details - Which browsers you've tested, operating
  system, etc.
  5. Stripe dashboard screenshots - Maybe a screenshot of your test mode product/price
  configuration to confirm it matches

  This gives the LLM comprehensive context while emphasizing the need for minimal,
  targeted changes that won't break your working functionality.
  
  REFERENCE
  
  See my Stripe sandbox prod and price IDs at "Stripe Sandbox Dashboard 2025-09-21 200145.png".
  
  In Vercel, when I test the version of the app from my latest commit, the invoice and PDF download functionality are good, but the $5 unlock button throws an error on opening and on click. On click, it says, "Payment system error. Please try again."
