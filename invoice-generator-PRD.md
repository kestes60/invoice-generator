# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Simple Invoice Generator
## Product Overview

Name: QuickInvoice (or whatever you like—changeable).
Description: A single-page web app for freelancers/small businesses to generate professional PDF invoices. Users input details via a form, preview on-screen, and download. Free version includes a watermark; paid ($5 one-time) removes it and adds custom branding.
Target Users: Freelancers (writers, designers), solopreneurs needing quick invoices without full tools like QuickBooks.
Value Prop: Saves 10-15 mins per invoice; dead simple, no signup. Monetize via Stripe for premium.
Success Metrics: 100 users/month, 10% conversion to paid, $50/month revenue goal. Deploy to GitHub Pages/Vercel.
Constraints: One HTML file (index.html) with embedded CSS/JS for simplicity. No backend/database. Client-side only. Build time: <1 hour.

## Key Features (MVP)

### Invoice Form:

Fields: Your business name/logo (text input), Client name/email/address, Invoice # (auto-generate or input), Date (auto-today), Due date (datepicker), Line items (dynamic: add/remove rows for description, quantity, rate, total), Subtotal/Tax (input %), Grand Total (auto-calc).
UI: Clean form with labels, inputs, + button for item rows. Use semantic HTML for accessibility.


### Preview Pane:

Real-time update: As user types, show formatted invoice preview (e.g., in a bordered div styled like paper). Include sections: Header (your biz), Bill To, Items table, Totals, Footer (thanks/note).
Watermark: Overlay "Generated by QuickInvoice - Upgrade to remove" in free mode (hide via JS flag post-payment).


### Generate & Download:

Button: "Download PDF" – Uses jsPDF library (CDN: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js) to convert preview to PDF. Auto-include date/filename like "invoice-123.pdf".
Error handling: Validate form (e.g., require client name), show alerts.


### Monetization:

Free tier: Watermarked PDF + subtle ad banner (e.g., Google AdSense script if you add later).
Premium: "$5 Unlock" button → Stripe Checkout (CDN: https://js.stripe.com/v3/). On success (via redirect or simple callback), set localStorage flag to hide watermark. Use your publishable key: pk_test_... (prompt me to replace). No server needed for MVP—handle via client redirect.
Post-payment: Redirect back to app with success message, enable premium features.


### Extras for Polish:

Responsive: Mobile-friendly (media queries).
Theme: Minimalist—use Tailwind CSS via CDN for quick styling (e.g., sans-serif font, blue accents).
Persist: localStorage for form data across sessions.
Analytics: Optional Google Analytics snippet for traffic.



## Tech Stack

Frontend: Vanilla HTML5/CSS3/JS (ES6+). No frameworks to keep light.
Libraries (CDN only):

jsPDF for PDF gen.
Stripe.js for payments.
Tailwind CSS for UI (optional but recommended for fast design).


Deployment: Static site—index.html only. GitHub Pages: Repo > Settings > Pages > Deploy from main. Vercel: Connect GitHub, auto-deploys on push.
Browser Support: Modern (Chrome/Firefox/Safari latest).

## User Flow

Load page → See hero: "Generate Invoices in Seconds" + form.
Fill form → Preview updates live.
Click Download → If free, show watermark PDF; prompt upgrade if desired.
Upgrade → Stripe modal → Pay $5 → Back to app, watermark gone, re-download clean.

## Edge Cases to Handle

Empty form: Disable download, show "Fill details first".
Calc errors: Use parseFloat/Number for totals, handle NaN.
Stripe fail: Graceful error ("Payment issue—try again"). Test mode only.
PDF issues: Fallback to print preview if jsPDF glitches.

## Design Guidelines

Simple & Functional: White background, max 800px wide form, green "Download" button. No flashy animations.
Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard nav, alt text if logo.
Colors: Neutral (grays/whites) + brand blue (#3B82F6).
